## Deploy

If you would like to deploy it yourself, please follow these steps:

### Manually

1. Install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. Install [MongoDB Community](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)
3. Download dependencies with `go mod download`
4. Create a `.env` file with a [GitHub token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) (look at `.env.example`)
5. Run with `go run *.go`

### Docker (Recommended)

1. Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with the [Compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)
2. Create a `.env` file with a [GitHub token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) (look at `.env.example`)
3. Build an image with `docker compose up` (add `-d` if you want to run it in the background)

Don't forget to run tests `go test` to make sure everything works correctly!

### Reverse Proxy and SSL/TLS

* To avoid having to send all requests to port 8080, you want to setup a reverse proxy that will forward traffic through port 80 (the default port when accessing websites)
    * If this wasn't setup, you would have to access the website through `badges.temir.dev:8080` instead of regular `badges.temir.dev`
* To avoid using HTTP and use secure HTTPS instead, you want to receive an SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt, which is automatable with `certbot`
    * If this wasn't setup, you would have to make requests to `http://badges.temir.dev` instead of `https://badges.temir.dev` and it would cause problems with common browsers

Find how to accomplish both of these things in this article: [here](https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/)

## CI/CD

To make sure this project is properly maintained, I used GitHub workflows to test and automatically deploy to Oracle Cloud [Micro Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm) that comes with [Always Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/)

You can find workflows under [Actions](https://github.com/dtemir/git-badges-golang/actions)

1. [check_build.yml](https://github.com/dtemir/git-badges-golang/blob/main/.github/workflows/check_build.yml) to make sure Go compiles
2. [check_compose.yml](https://github.com/dtemir/git-badges-golang/blob/main/.github/workflows/check_compose.yml) to make sure [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/dtemir/git-badges-golang/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) is up-to-date
3. [deploy.yml](https://github.com/dtemir/git-badges-golang/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to deploy the latest changes to Oracle Cloud
